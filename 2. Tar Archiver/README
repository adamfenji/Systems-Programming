# CS3411 - Project 2: Tar Archiver 

## Description
This project implements a simple tar archiver tool (`ctar`) and a corresponding untar tool (`utar`). The archiver allows for appending files to an archive, deleting files from an archive, and extracting files from the archive.

## Requirements
- C Compiler (gcc)
- Linux operating system, on campus lab computers
- Make

## Compilation
To compile the project, use the provided Makefile. Simply run:
```bash
make
```

## Usage

### Creating an Archive
To create a new archive and append files to it:
```bash
./ctar -a <archive-name> <file1> <file2> ...
```

### Deleting from an Archive
To delete files from an existing archive:
```bash
./ctar -d <archive-name> <file1> <file2> ...
```

### Extracting from an Archive
To extract all files from an archive:
```bash
./utar <archive-name>
```

## Testing

A `TESTS` folder is provided with sample text files (`file1.txt`, `file2.txt`) and an empty archive (`archive.tar`). You can run the following commands to test the functionality:

### Create Empty Archive:
Create an empty archive. This verifies that the archive file is properly created with a valid header.
```bash
./ctar -a test_archive.tar
```

### Append Files
Append files to the archive. Verify that the files are properly stored and the header is updated.
```bash
./ctar -a test_archive.tar file1.txt file2.txt
```

### Deleting Files from Archive
Delete a file from the archive. Verify that `file1.txt` is marked as deleted in the header but the content remains intact.
```bash
./ctar -d test_archive.tar file1.txt
```

### Extract Files from Archive
Extract the files from the archive. Verify that the extracted files have the correct content and permissions.
```bash
./utar test_archive.tar
```

### Error Handling for Non-Existing File
Test the program's error handling. The program should return an appropriate error without modifying the archive.
```bash
./ctar -a test_archive.tar non_existing_file.txt
```

## Known Issues
- File overwrite handling during extraction is limited.
